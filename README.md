# UnifiedGranularIntrusionDynamics
The information contained in this repository is for the purpose of code and data availability for Ruck et al., 2025 "Unified Granular Intrusion Dynamics for Planetary Exploration".

For laboratory data collected using the robot intrusion leg, please navigate to the following compressed folders: for sand data, please navigate to the "T2_zipped" folder, for glass beads data, navigate to the "glassBeads_zipped" folder, for LHS-1 w/o fines, navigate to the "LHS1_zipped" folder, and for LHS-1 w/ fines, navigate to the "LHS1_fines_zipped" folder. 

To access the Python code written to process laboratory penetration test data, please navigate to the "Intrusion Experiments-Penny" folder. This folder contains the "LabIntrusion_VolumeFrac_Penny.ipynb" file and "NASA_Ames_Penetration.ipynb" file, where there is code used for producing plots seen in Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5D & 5E, as well as Supplemental Figures S1

To access the Python code written to plot grain sizes and topography data, used in producing Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure S2, and the inset of Figure 3B, navigate to the "Intrusion Experiments-Penny" folder, where you will find the "Paper2_Materials_GrainSizes.ipynb" and "WRANGLER_Intrusion_SurfaceDisplacement.ipynb" files.
